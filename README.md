# Basic
This is a community transplant branch and has no interest relationship with the official company.<BR>
You can obtain tutorials and FAQs in the <a href="https://www.fairygui.com/">official websit</a>.<BR>

# Note
1.The Dota2 platform's web has removed some features, which may result in some functions being unusable.<BR>
2.Due to the lack of IO interface specificity on the Dota2 platform, all interface data is currently saved in code files and converted to ArrayBuffer during initialization.<BR>

# Advance
1.WYSIWYG. You don't need to write additional xml and css files. It is automatically exported to TypeScript data binding. The variable name corresponds to the editor one by one and can be used directly.<BR>
2.Cross platform: All interfaces written using the fgui editor can be seamlessly migrated to other engines.<BR>
3.Added support for vertical alignment of text.<BR>
4.Fix some native bugs in rich text.<BR>
5.There is no longer a need to design CSS separately for different resolutions. By association, the tedious operation of adapting Dota2 to different resolutions can be eliminated.<BR>
6.Expand the native components of Dota2: skill icons, item icons, player avatars, models, special effects, etc.<BR>
7.Add the function of automatic segmentation of Luoshu Square. <BR>
